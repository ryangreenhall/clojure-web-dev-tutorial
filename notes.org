Web Development in Clojure

* 1. Intro to lein
** Overview
** project.clj
** Specifying dependencies
* 2. Ring basics
** Handlers
** Representing requests and responses as maps
** Parameters
** First "Hello World" app using lein-ring (using hand-rolled routing)
** middleware
* 3. Compojure
** Routing
** mime types
* 4. Deployment
** Lets get the hello world app live on heroku
** Discuss alternative deployment options. E.g Generate an uberjar
* 5. The Monitoring Dashboard
** Imagine that you have an online business capturing orders. You would like a dashboard that shows
   the number of orders made, status of background job queues.
** Templating with clj-jade
** Adding some style (general static resource handling)
* 6. Stories (needs fleshing out)
** Number of orders - Show the number of orders that have been made today so far
** Number of failed jobs on the email queue
** The number of email jobs should be red when over 0


Perhaps have skeleton code with key pieces to be added by the attendees?


* TODO
** Do we mention nginx?
** Where do we deploy?
   Heroku (easy, but a black box)
   shared ec2 instance (harder, but full transparency as to what is going on)

** Web frameworks worth mentioning?
   Pedestal - http://pedestal.io/
   Luminus - http://www.luminusweb.net/
   Noir (although I think it's unsupported now) - http://www.webnoir.org/

** Templating libraries worth being aware of
   Hiccup
   Moustache
