;; 1. Define a route which responds to requests to "/" and returns a response with the body set to "hello world"

;; 2. Define a route which responds to /greet/(any-name) where any name is a url parameter, and returns a response
;;    with the body set to a "Hello (any-name)",
;;    e.g. request  -> /greet/jon
;;         response -> "hello jon"

;; 3. Define a route which responds to /error-name which returns a status code of 500 and a body containing a friendly
;;    error message

;; 4. Try handling query string parameters

;; 5. Add a route and protect it with Ring Basic Auth Middleware 

;; 6. Add an endpoint which returns json

;; 7. Add a route which gets data from the endpoint you wrote in 6., and depending on some aspect of it, 
;;    returns a different result (hint, try the clj-http library)
